        <h1>About Tyler</h1>
        <p>This is a paragrapgh about me. Here's a few new things you may not have learned about me:</p>
        <p>I speak Italian fluently. Though I'm four generations down from 100% italian blood, my respect and interest in the culture drove myself to teach myself the language.
            Also, I'm very interested in being a TA so keep your eyes out for me! I'm the only student who raised their hand when you asked: "So, who actually wants to be a Project Manager?"
